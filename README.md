Colorbot/aimbot for Arduino Leonardo R3.  
Leonardo acts as a mouse and gets instructions from host machine through ethernet. 

Hardware required:
- Arduino Leonardo R3
- Ethernet Shield
- USB to Ethernet adapter (Optional)
  
Software required:
- Arduino IDE
  
Spoofing the Leonardo is required for some games but since this is for educational purposes only I am not going to give any instructions for that.
